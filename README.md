## 🏗 Architecture
SpendWise follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern to ensure separation of concerns and testability.

*   **Model (Data Layer)**:
    *   **Room Database**: The single source of truth for all data.
    *   **Repository**: Mediates between the ViewModel and the Database.
    *   **DAO (Data Access Object)**: Defines database interactions.
*   **ViewModel**:
    *   Holds UI state and survives configuration changes.
    *   Exposes data to the View via `LiveData`/`Flow`.
*   **View (UI Layer)**:
    *   **Fragments**: Observe the ViewModel and update the UI accordingly.
    *   **XML Layouts**: Define the visual structure.

## 🗄 Database Design
The app uses a relational database structure powered by Room.

*   **Expense Entity**: Stores transaction amount, date, description, and category ID.
*   **Category Entity**: Stores category names, icons, and colors.
*   **RecurringExpense**: Definitions for automated transaction creation.
*   **SavingsGoal**: Tracks target amounts and current progress.
*   **SplitGroup / SplitMember**: Relational tables for managing shared expenses.

---

## 🎨 UI & Design Principles
*   **Material Design 3**: Utilizes the latest Android design language for a cohesive look.
*   **Single Activity Architecture**: Uses one `MainActivity` hosting multiple `Fragments`.
*   **Responsive**: Layouts adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
*   **Accessibility**: High contrast colors and properly labeled elements.
